This contains all programming files for project 1. 


-----------------Instructions-----------------------


To compile "project1.cpp", run the following command:

$ g++ -g -Wall project1.cpp -o Project1.exe

Thereafter you can run "Project1.exe" using:

$ ./Project1.exe

You will get prompted to enter an n value to calculate u and v. Enter "0" to generate files for all n-values(10^1, 10^2,.., 10^5). The program will also return the time it took to calculate for each n to the terminal. After running the program, you can generate the plots by using the following command.

$ python new_plot.py



-----------------Comments:----------------------
When launcing "Project1.exe" you can enter any n-value you'd like, as long as it does not need more memory than the computer can handle.

"plotdata.py" will generate the same plots as "new_plot.py", but only for one spesific n value at a time. It takes this n-value as an argument. For example, you can generate the plot for u(x), v(x), log(Delta) and log(epsilon) for n=1000 by using the following command:

$ python plotdata.py 1000

Make sure that the the values are generated by Project1.exe before attempting to plot.
